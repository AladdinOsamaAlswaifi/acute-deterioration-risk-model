# acute-deterioration-risk-model
  Clinical machine learning project exploring early warning prediction in acute care.


## Planned steps:
  - Dataset preparation
  - Baseline model training
  - Explainability and clinical interpretation
  - Deployment considerations


## Clinical Motivation
  Early recognition of deterioration is critical in Acute Medicine to support timely escalation, reduce ICU admissions, and improve patient safety.

## Project Goals
- Build baseline predictive models for deterioration risk
- Evaluate performance using clinically meaningful metrics (AUC, sensitivity)
- Explore explainability and limitations relevant to real-world deployment
- Consider governance, safety, and workflow integration challenges

## Status
  🚧 In progress (February 2026)

## Planned Steps
- Dataset preparation (MIMIC-style vital signs dataset)
- Baseline model training (logistic regression, random forest)
- Explainability and clinical interpretation (feature importance / SHAP)
- Deployment considerations (false negatives, monitoring, safety case thinking)

## Next Update
Notebook 01: Data loading + initial exploration (Week 1–2)
