## Dataset Source
Hospital Clinical Deterioration Dataset from Kaggle (Feb 2026).

## About Dataset
Overview
  This dataset contains a simulated hospital cohort designed for building and evaluating early warning models for clinical deterioration.
  10,000 realistic hospital admissions in a high-fidelity 72-hour monitoring cohor

For each hospital admission, you get up to 72 consecutive hours of data from the time the patient arrives, including:
  Hourly vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO₂, temperature, oxygen support, mobility score, nurse alerts)
  Hourly lab results (WBC, lactate, creatinine, CRP, hemoglobin, sepsis risk score)
  Patient-level information (age, gender, comorbidity index, admission type, baseline risk, length of stay)
  Several deterioration outcomes, with a main focus on “deterioration in the next 12 hours”

## Contents
Includes physiological observations such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and temperature.

## Next Step
Load into Pandas and define a proxy deterioration outcome.
