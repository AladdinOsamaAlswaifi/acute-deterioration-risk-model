# Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks used to develop the **Acute Deterioration Risk Prediction (NEWS2-style)** project.

The notebooks are organised in a step-by-step workflow, from initial dataset exploration to baseline modelling and evaluation.

## Notebook Roadmap

### 01_data_loading.ipynb
- Loads the selected vital signs dataset  
- Performs initial inspection (`head`, `info`, missing values)  
- Defines the target outcome for deterioration prediction

### 02_preprocessing.ipynb *(planned)*
- Data cleaning and feature preparation  
- Handling missing data  
- Train/test split

### 03_baseline_model.ipynb *(planned)*
- Baseline model training (logistic regression, random forest)  
- Performance evaluation using clinically meaningful metrics

### 04_explainability.ipynb *(planned)*
- Feature importance and model interpretability  
- Discussion of limitations, bias, and safety considerations

## Notes

This project is part of an independent **Clinical AI & Digital Health portfolio** focused on safe and responsible adoption of AI tools in acute care workflows.

Status: 🚧 In progress (February–April 2026)
